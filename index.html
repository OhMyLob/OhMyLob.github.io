                    I love Android and I'm familiar with Java and Kotlin. Functionality has always been the key of my projects,
                    but design is also very important to me. In fact, I always follow Google Material's guidelines when
                    I develop Android apps.

                        This is an Android Launcher app made from scratch. 
			The launcher doesn't include much customization, you can only change wallpaper, 
			the dock icons and the Icon Pack, as it's only been an experiment to me, 
			trying to do my best with smooth animation and transitions, bringing a new modern 
			look to my phone. 
			The second dock that appears when you slide on the first dock or open the App drawer is dynamic and brings your most launched apps always visible. 
			The app includes Homescreen gestures, swipe up to open the App drawer, swipe down to expand the StatusBar. 
			Android Nougat 7.1 Shortcuts are supported with a new layout that uses the Material BottomSheet component.
